More formally, if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.\\n\\nA permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. The number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time is denoted by P(n, r) and is calculated as P(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!.\\n\\nA combination is a selection of objects where the order does not matter. The number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is denoted by C(n, r) or (n choose r) and is calculated as C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!).\\n\\nDo you want me to provide examples or more details on any of these topics?\",\n",
