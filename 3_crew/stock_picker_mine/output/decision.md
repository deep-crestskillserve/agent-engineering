  "chosen_company": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)",
  "rationale": "AMD is chosen due to its focused approach on the rapidly expanding AI chip market, coupled with its potential for growth in the data center space. Its advancements in AI chips and increasing market share make it an attractive investment. The smaller data center revenue implies significant growth potential in the AI inference market.",

    {
      "name": "Samsung Electronics (SSNLF)",
      "reason": "While Samsung is a strong company with a diversified business and a significant deal with Tesla for AI chip production, it faces strong competition in the AI chip market from TSMC. AMD's focused approach on AI provides a higher-risk, higher-reward investment opportunity compared to Samsung's more diversified portfolio."
